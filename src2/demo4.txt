The Last Tree in the Field
There was a wide empty field near the village. Long ago, many trees grew there. Over time, people cut them down to build houses and roads. In the end, only one tree remained. It stood alone in the center of the field.
The tree was old and tall. Its branches were thin, but strong. Birds still came to rest on it. In the hot summer, its shade was the only cool place nearby. Most people walked past it without care.
A young boy named Kunal visited the field every evening. He liked to sit under the tree and read his book. The tree made him feel calm. When the wind blew, the leaves made soft sounds, like quiet music.
One day, Kunal heard adults talking. They said the tree would be cut down soon. A new building was planned for the field. Kunal felt a heavy feeling in his chest. The field would be empty and silent without the tree.
That night, Kunal could not sleep. The next morning, he tied a small note to the tree. It said, “This tree gives us shade and life. Please do not cut it.” He also planted small seeds near its roots.
Days passed. More notes appeared on the tree. Other children and even adults wrote messages. Some brought water for the tree. Some cleaned the area around it.
When the workers arrived, they stopped and read the notes. They talked among themselves. Later, the village leader came to see the tree. After a long talk, the plan was changed.
The building was moved to another place. The tree stayed.
Seasons changed, and the tree grew stronger. Small plants grew around it. The field slowly became green again.
Kunal still sits under the tree, smiling. He learned that even one small voice can protect something important, if it speaks with care.
