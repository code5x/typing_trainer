The Quiet Morning Train
Every morning, the small train left the town at exactly six o’clock. It was old, slow, and painted blue, with scratches on every door. Most people did not notice it anymore. For them, it was just part of daily life. But for Arun, this train meant something special.
Arun worked in a city far away. He took the train every day, holding the same ticket, sitting on the same seat near the window. He liked watching the sky change colors as the sun slowly rose. The morning air felt cool and fresh, and the town looked calm and sleepy.
One morning, Arun saw a new passenger. She was reading a book and smiling softly. She looked peaceful, like she belonged to the quiet morning. Arun wanted to talk, but he stayed silent. He believed mornings should be gentle and not rushed.
As days passed, they shared the same train again and again. Sometimes their eyes met, and they nodded politely. No words were spoken, yet something warm grew between them. Arun started waking up earlier, just to enjoy the ride more.
One day, the train stopped suddenly. There was a small problem on the track. People became restless. The silence broke. The girl closed her book and sighed. Arun finally spoke and asked if she was okay. She smiled and said she was fine, just a little late.
They talked until the train moved again. They spoke about work, dreams, and favorite places. The ride felt shorter than ever.
The next morning, the train arrived as usual. Arun looked around, but the seat was empty. Days passed, and she did not return. The quiet felt louder now.
Still, Arun smiled during every ride. The train had given him a small story, a gentle memory, and a reminder that even simple mornings can change us.
