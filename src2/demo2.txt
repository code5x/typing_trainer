The Lamp on the Corner
At the end of Maple Street, there was an old street lamp. It stood on the corner, tall and quiet. Its yellow light was soft and warm. People passed it every day, but no one really looked at it anymore.
Ravi noticed the lamp because his house was right across the street. Every night, he sat near his window and watched it glow. When the lamp was on, the street felt safe. When it was off, the road looked empty and strange.
One evening, a strong storm came. The wind was loud, and rain hit the ground hard. Ravi saw the lamp flicker. The light went on and off again and again. Finally, it went dark. The street felt cold without it.
The next morning, Ravi saw people talking near the lamp. Some said it was too old. Some said it should be removed. Ravi felt sad. The lamp had been there since his childhood. It had watched him grow up, walk to school, and come home late.
That night, Ravi wrote a letter to the town office. He wrote about the lamp and how it made the street feel alive. He wrote about memories, safety, and quiet comfort. He did not know if anyone would read it.
Days passed. The lamp stayed dark. Ravi still looked at it every night.
One evening, he heard a sound outside. Workers were fixing something. Sparks flew, and tools clinked. Ravi waited and held his breath.
Then the light came back on. It shone brighter than before. The street looked warm again. Ravi smiled and felt proud.
The lamp still stands on Maple Street. It does not speak or move. But every night, it lights the way, reminding Ravi that small things can matter a lot.
