The Forgotten Notebook
Maya found the notebook in the back of her cupboard. It was covered in dust and had a torn blue cover. She picked it up slowly, trying to remember when she last saw it. Her name was written on the first page, in her own handwriting.
She sat on the floor and opened it. Inside were short notes, simple drawings, and small stories. Some pages talked about school. Some talked about friends she no longer met. Maya smiled as she turned each page. It felt like meeting an old version of herself.
One page said, “I want to travel and see the sea.” Another page said, “I want to write stories every day.” Maya closed the notebook for a moment. Life had become busy. Work, phone calls, and worries had filled her days. She had stopped writing long ago.
That evening, the power went out. The room became quiet. Maya lit a candle and sat near the window. The notebook was still in her hands. The soft light made the pages look warm and alive.
She picked up a pen and turned to a blank page. At first, she did not know what to write. Her mind felt slow. Then she started with one simple line. She wrote about her day. She wrote about the quiet room and the sound of the wind outside.
The words came slowly, but they felt honest. Maya wrote until the candle burned low. She felt calm, like something lost had returned.
The next day, she placed the notebook on her desk, not back in the cupboard. Every night, she wrote a little. Some days it was only a few lines. Some days it was a full page.
The notebook was no longer forgotten. It became a small space just for her. Through simple words, Maya found joy again, one page at a time.
