The Clock That Waited
In the living room of an old house, there was a wall clock that never moved. Its hands were stuck at seven fifteen. The clock was round, wooden, and slightly cracked. Everyone said it was broken, but Nisha did not believe that.
Nisha had grown up in that house. She remembered the sound of the clock ticking when she was a child. It was slow and steady. It made the house feel alive. Then one day, the ticking stopped. Life moved on, but the clock stayed the same.
Years later, Nisha returned to the house after a long time. The rooms were quiet and dusty. When she entered the living room, she saw the clock still on the wall. Seven fifteen. Just like before.
She sat on the sofa and looked around. Memories came back. Tea with her parents. Soft laughter. Evening talks. She realized that seven fifteen was the time her family used to sit together every day.
Nisha gently opened the clock. Inside, the parts were old but not broken. She cleaned it carefully and replaced a small battery. She hung it back on the wall and stepped back.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then the clock made a soft sound. Tick. Tick. The hands began to move again. Nisha felt tears in her eyes. The sound filled the room, slow and calm.
That evening, she made tea and sat in the living room. The clock showed the correct time now, but it felt special. It felt like the house was breathing again.
Nisha decided not to sell the house. She wanted to keep it alive, just like the clock.
The clock did not wait because it was broken. It waited for the right moment. And when that moment came, it began to move again, reminding Nisha that some things only need care, not replacement.
